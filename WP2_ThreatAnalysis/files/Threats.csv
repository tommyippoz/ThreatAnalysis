CA,43; 46,15,Conduct communications interception attacks. ,Adversary takes advantage of communications that are either unencrypted; use weak encryption (e.g.; encryption containing publically known flaws) or permitted information flows (e.g.; email communication; removable storage); to gain access to transmitted information and channels.
CA,44,16,Conduct wireless jamming attacks. ,Adversary takes measures to interfere with wireless communications so as to impede or prevent communications from reaching intended recipients.
CA,45,17,Conduct attacks using unauthorized ports; protocols and services.,Adversary conducts attacks using ports; protocols; and services for ingress and egress that are not authorized for use by organizations.
CA,47; 48; 49; 66,18,Conduct Denial of Service (DoS) attack. ,Adversary attempts to make an Internet-accessible resource unavailable to intended users; or prevent the resource from functioning efficiently or at all; temporarily or indefinitely.
CA,50; 51,19,Conduct physical attacks on organizational facilities. ,Adversary conducts a physical attack on organizational facilities or infrastructures (e.g.; sets a fire; breaks a water main; cuts a power line).
CA,52; 54; 56; 57,20,Conduct cyber-physical attacks on organizational facilities; session hijacking or brute force attempts.,Adversary conducts a cyber-physical attack on organizational facilities (e.g.; remotely changes HVAC settings); takes control of (hijacks) already established with the aim to legitimate information or leads systematic guessing of passwords; possibly supported by password cracking utilities .
CA,58; 59,21,Conduct Man In the Middle attacks.,Adversary; operating outside organizational systems; intercepts/eavesdrops on sessions between organizational and external systems. Adversary then relays messages between organizational and external systems; making them believe that they are talking directly to each other over a private connection; when in fact the entire communication is controlled by the adversary. Such attacks are of particular concern for organizational use of community; hybrid; and public clouds.
CA,60; 61; 62,22,Conduct social engineering attacks targeting and compromising personal devices of critical employees.,Adversary  takes actions (e.g.; using email; phone) with the intent of persuading or otherwise tricking individuals within organizations into revealing critical/sensitive information (e.g.; personally identifiable information). The main targets are key organizational employees by placing malware on their personally owned information systems and devices (e.g.; laptop/notebook computers; personal digital assistants; smart phones).

AR,75; 76,25,Obtain information by opportunistically stealing or scavenging information systems/components.,Adversary steals information systems or components (e. g.; laptop computers or data storage media) that are left unattended outside of the physical perimeters of organizations; or scavenges discarded components. Adversary can also scan or mine information on publically accessible servers and web pages of organizations with the intent of finding sensitive information.
CC,79; 80; 84,26,Coordinate a campaign of multi-staged  (e.g.; hopping) or multi-typed (e.g outsider; insider; supplier) attacks.,Adversary combines attacks that require both physical presence within organizational facilities and cyber methods to achieve success. Physical attack steps may be as simple as convincing maintenance personnel to leave doors or cabinets open.
CC,81; 83,27,Coordinate campaigns across multiple organizations to acquire specific information or achieve desired outcome.,Adversary does not limit planning to the targeting of one organization. Adversary observes multiple organizations to acquire necessary information on targets of interest.
CC,82,28,Coordinate a campaign that spreads attacks across organizational systems from existing presence.,Adversary uses existing presence within organizational systems to extend the adversary?s span of control to other organizational systems including organizational infrastructure. Adversary thus is in position to further undermine organizational ability to carry out missions/business functions.
ACC,85,29,Spill sensitive information,Authorized user erroneously contaminates a device; information system; or network by placing on it or sending to it information of a classification/sensitivity which it has not been authorized to handle. The information is exposed to access by unauthorized individuals; and as a result; the device; system; or network is unavailable while the spill is investigated and mitigated.
