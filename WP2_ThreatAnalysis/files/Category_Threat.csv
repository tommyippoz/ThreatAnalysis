Group,IRENE Index,Motivation
CON,1,Information shared in networks can be sniffed from connections
CON,3,Connection can be surveilled to get information about vulnerabilities
CON,6,Connection can be sniffed to collect data related to network traffic
CON,15,Communications can be intercepted directly from the link
CON,19,Communications can be broke up by physical attacks aimed to interrupt the exchange of data
EP,3,Since energy providers are key buildings; a surveillance could be lead to undestand vulnerabilities of the system.
EP,5,Since energy providers can have huge support coming from software systems depending on the functionality; adversary mmight want to deliver malware into that software
EP,6,Energy Providers need to communicate with the grid to understand useful indications about the generation of energy; so a sniffer activity colud reveal lot of information about policies
EP,7,Energy providers works with employers; and subverted individuals can act the part of a simple employer and damage the structure
EP,8,Energy providers works with employers; and the access of authorized staff can be exploited
EP,14,Control software could be targeted especially due to its criticality
EP,19,Since energy providers are physical buildings; physical attacks could be lead with success
EP,22,Energy providers works with employers; and their devices could be compromised with the aim to reveal critical information
EP,26,Due to the complexity and the relevance of the tasks performed by the energy provider; multi - staged attacks can be conducted to defeat protections against attackers
EP,27,Since in the city scenario multiple organizations that provides energy are working simoultaneously; the attacker can try to observe different companies to acquire useful data to break defenses of target provider
EP,28,When a malicious presence is working in this type of city component; the actions can damage also other component; since the energy is needed in each of the city's services
EP,30,Energy providers works with employers; and users can inadvertently expose information to other people
EP,32,Since this component has a physical state; earthquakes can damage it
EP,33,Since this component has a physical state; fire can damage it
EP,34,Since this component has a physical state; flood can damage it
EP,35,Since this component has a physical state; hurricanes can damage it
BLD,2,Builings are inserted in a city with specific purposes; that can be publically accessible and available also for adversaries
BLD,3,Each building can have its vulnerabilities; and the adversary wants to discover most of them
BLD,7,Building's employers can be inserted by adversarial organizations to obtain access to critical data
BLD,8,Building's employers have permissions to avoid security checks; that can be exploited from adversary
BLD,12,The physical and organizational evolution of companies that use building can introduce vulnerabilities in the cyber-physical structure
BLD,14,Each building has its software system depending on the functionalities and the adversary wants to insert malware to get data or compromise operations
BLD,19,Buildings are physical components; so is possible to conduct physical attacks aimed to damage them
BLD,26,Due to the complexity and the relevance of some of the tasks performed by the company that owns the building; multi - staged attacks can be conducted to defeat protections against attackers
BLD,28,When a malicious presence is working in this type of city component; the actions can damage also other component; depending on the specificity of that building
BLD,32,Since this component has a physical state; earthquakes can damage it
BLD,33,Since this component has a physical state; fire can damage it
BLD,34,Since this component has a physical state; flood can damage it
BLD,35,Since this component has a physical state; hurricanes can damage it
DAC,5,Data Center control most of the smartness of the grid; so adversary might want to compromise the functionalities with different kind of malwares
DAC,6,Data Center control most of the smartness of the grid and needs lot of data that can be observed during the execution
DAC,9,Data Center can be very complex; and the security configurations must be well-tailored to avoid adversary intrusions
DAC,10,Communications to and from data center need to open tunnels that could be left oopen by applications that are not well-written
DAC,14,Due to the complexity and the criticalty of Data Center actions; the adversary might want to insert malware to get data or compromise operations
DAC,15,Communications to and from data center can be intercepted to limit or damage the effectiveness of techniques managed from this component
DAC,16,Data Centers are exposed to jamming attacks aimed to block or damage the usual traffic on the network
DAC,17,Since data is coming in a huge quantities from different ports or protocols; adversary can try to exploit these wider range of connections to found vulnerabilities
DAC,18,Data Centers are exposed to denial of service attacks aimed to block or damage the usual traffic on the network
DAC,20,Data Centers are key components; so adversaries could want to attack the systems in cyber-physical ways
DAC,23,Integrity of data is a pillar to the correct behavior of the Data Center; so adversary could try to damage it leading this component to take wrong decisions
DAC,24,Data Centers are exposed to compromisation of policies; permissions; ports and channels also due to violations to authorization controls
DAC,29,Data is coming also from devices; that can be contaminated and prepared to send wrong or malicious data to Data Center
DAC,31,A data center can have specific setups about the permissions and protocols to use; and privileges can be setupped in a wrong way
DAC,36,Data Center are key components with huge support of resources that degrade due to continuous usage
DAC,37,Data Center are key components with huge information support systems (especially for auuthentication); so software could be affected by bugs that lead to vulnerabilities
DAC,38,Data Center are key components with huge support of hard drive resources that can fail due to usage; depletion or read write errors.
