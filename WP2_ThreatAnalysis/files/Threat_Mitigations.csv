IRENE Index,IRENE Event,Mitigation Index(es),Motivation
1,Perform perimeter network reconnaissance/scanning.,11; 12; 18,To limit the amount of information collected by scanning; we can improve media (11); physical (12) and communication (18) protection 
2,Gather information using open source discovery of organizational information.,11,The only way to limit the analisys of open source data is to decrease the amount of sensitive knowledge shared with the community
3,Perform reconnaissance and surveillance of targeted organizations.,4; 12; 16; 19,When an organization is surveiled; monitoring (4) and risk assessment (16) facilities could help to understand if someone is ready to steal informations from you; check the integrity (19) and the physical security (12) is also a way to improve this protection.
4,Craft phishing attacks. ,14; 15; 18,The implementation of a security program is mandatory to limit this type of problems. The user must be aware (15) of this type of attacks; and also the communications (18) need to be protected from middle intrusions. 
5,Create and operate false front organizations to inject malicious components into the supply chain or deliver known/modified malware to internal organizational information systems.,5; 17; 19,Every component need to come from a trusted organization (17) and also need to be tested (5) before inserting it into any organizational process. In this way; we become able also to detect malicious code (19) inserted into the new components.
6,Install sniffers or scanning devices on organizational information systems and networks.,4; 17; 19,Each component needs to come from a trusted organization (17) and checked to detect malicious code (19); in that case; monitoring activities could help to understand if therre are some new untrusted streams or actions appeared on the context that execute suspect code.
7,Insert subverted individuals into organizations. ,1; 2; 4,It is mandatory to regulate (2) the way personnel access computer programs and applications; and control the access (1) of each of them every time; also using some monitoring (4) facilities.
8,Exploit physical access of authorized staff to gain access to organizational facilities.,1; 4; 12; 15,The first step is to assume personnel only after a regulated and controlled process (15). Althrough you have to monitor (4) their activities - also the physical access (12) - to understand if some suspicious actions are performed.
9,Exploit poorly configured or unauthorized information systems exposed to the Internet.,1; 2; 7; 10,The exposition is due to a lack of access control (1) (2) and authentication (7) policies. An efficient mantainance process has to be conducted in order to check and update the system configurations.
10,Exploit split tunneling. ,4; 18,All the comminucations must follow a defined protocol (18) that avoid to keep opened an unused connection. To support this protection technique; checking; investigation and monitoring facilities (4) can be adopted.
11,Exploit known vulnerabilities in mobile systems (e.g.; laptops; PDAs; smart phones).,16; 17; 18,The vulnerabilities need to be assessed (16) in order to know which are the weaknesses of the system. Once that vulnerabilities are discovered; the acquisition of new components cannot add new vulnerabilities (17); and the communication links between the system and the devices (18) needs to be protected.
12,Exploit recently discovered vulnerabilities. ,8; 10; 13; 16,New vulnerabilities can be due to the lackness of maintainance (10); a missing planning (13) process; risk assessment strategy (16) or sensitive data protection (8).
13,Compromise design; manufacture; and/or distribution of information system components (including hardware; software; and firmware)or devices used externally and reintroduced into the enterprise.,5; 17; 19,The reintroduction or the update of software needs to be maintained and checked (17); and some malware detection policies (19); in addition with an adequate management of the configurations (5) need to be implemented. 
14,Compromise software of organizational critical information systems.,4; 5; 19,If the compromisation could not be avoided with the management of the configurations (5); some monitoring (4) and malware detection policies (19) might be useful. 
15,Conduct communications interception attacks. ,2; 12; 18,People that work on communications need to be awared by this type of attacks to recognize and signal them as soon as they can (and if they can). Cyber-Phisical security on the communication links (12) (18) need to be improved to reduce the number of successful attacks.
16,Conduct wireless jamming attacks. ,6; 18,The jamming of wireless networks lead to the interruption of the communications; so continuity (6) and protection (18) policies needs to be created.
17,Conduct attacks using unauthorized ports; protocols and services.,1; 5; 7; 13,Attacks on unauthorized ports can be faced with improved access control (1) and identification (7) policies. The best solution remains the one that; after a complete and accurate planned configuration (5) (13); does not allows the exploiting of that ports.
18,Conduct Denial of Service (DoS) attack. , 4; 6; 10,Once the attack is detected using control policies (4) or when the service is denied due to the attack; the continuity of the operations (6) need to be guaranteed by a quick maintainance (10) intervention.
19,Conduct physical attacks on organizational facilities. ,2; 4; 12,"Obviously the physical assets needs to be protected (12) and the system (4) and the personnel (2) have to follow some ""training courses"" to timely detect the attack."
20,Conduct cyber-physical attacks on organizational facilities.,4; 6; 10; 12; 16; 19,The wider category of attacks that can be conducted against the system: risk assessment strategies (16) integrity checking (19). Physical assets need some type of protection (12) and in general maintainance (10); monitoring (4); and continuity of operations techniques help to face this ttype of threats.
21,Conduct Man In the Middle attacks.,2; 7; 18,The communication channels should block all the intrusion attempts (18); and also training of the personnel (2) and strong identification policies (7) could help to detect the attack before it damages hevily the whole system.                                     
22,Conduct social engineering attacks targeting and compromising personal devices of critical employees.,1; 8; 11; 19,Personal devices must also implement some content protection mechanisms (8) (11) and access control policies (1) in addition to malware detection utilities (19).
23,Cause integrity loss by creating; deleting; and/or modifying data on publicly accessible information systems (e.g.; web defacement).,1; 8; 10; 11; 13; 19,The access to public informations need to re supported from content protection mechanisms (8) (11) and access control policies (1) in addition to malware detection utilities (19). The integrity loss must be recovered through maintainance (10) operations and a strategic planning (13) to tolerate this type of attacks (e.g. multiple copies of a database).
24,Obtain unauthorized access. ,1; 3; 7,The access must be regulated (1) (7) and the actions must be compliant (3) with how expected for this user.
25,Obtain information by opportunistically stealing or scavenging information systems/components.,12; 14; 17,The theft of components must be avoided by protection policies (12) (17) and the security program management (14) have to support the system for these purposes.
26,Coordinate a campaign of multi-staged  (e.g.; hopping) or multi-typed (e.g outsider; insider; supplier) attacks.,4; 9; 10; 12,Different stages and different types of attacks can be very difficult to face; but incident response (9) and maintainance (10) techniques can speedup the recovery process; while moonitoring; checking (4) and pprotection (12) facilities could help to prevent or mitigate the problem.
27,Coordinate campaigns across multiple organizations to acquire specific information or achieve desired outcome.,1; 2; 4; 15,The access to orgaizatiional data must be regulated (1) and checked (4); and also the personnel (15) must be aware of these risks and prepared (2) to not be tricked and convinced to share sensible data.
28,Coordinate a campaign that spreads attacks across organizational systems from existing presence.,4; 9,The insider can be recognized also using monitoring techniques (4); and response (9) mechanisms must be implemented because of the high likelihood to do not reognize the threat before it becomes active.
29,Spill sensitive information,2; 8; 15,The information need to be protected (8) and the personnel (15) must be aware of these risks and prepared (2) to not be tricked and convinced to share sensible data.
30,Mishandling of critical and/or sensitive information by authorized users,10; 15,Accidental threat that can be less frequent if the user is as affordable as possible (15) and maintainance strategies are activated (10).
31,Incorrect privilege settings,1; 2; 13,The setup of the privileges might be wrong due to wrong access control (1) policies that are not compliant with the expectations (3) or a wrong planning (13) of some system protocols.
32,Earthquake at primary facility,-,
33,Fire at primary/backup facility ,-,
34,Flood at primary/backup facility,-,
35,Hurricane at primary/backup facility,-,
36,Resource depletion  ,6; 10; 13,The lackness of maintainance (10) or a wrong planning (13) of usage for that resources can expose the system to this typpe of threats that can also avoided implementing some tips aimed to guarantee the continuity of the operations (6).
37,Introduction of vulnerabilities into software products,4; 16; 17; 19,The accidental exposure to new vulnerabilities in response to an update or the acquisition of a new software can be limited by the verification (17) of the update source; and by conducting a risk assessment process (16) that for each update check the software witth support given by monitoring (4) and malware detection (19) facilities.
38,Disk error ,9; 10; 14,An hardware error can be mitigated only with maintainance (10) policies with the support of some incident response (9) ones.
